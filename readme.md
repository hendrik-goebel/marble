Having fun with HTML5 Canvas ended up in a in little app where marbles fall down and you can create crazy rhytms by adding and moving bars on the screen:

### How to use it

Create beats by draw blocks on the canves and let marble fall on them.
You can assign different sounds to different blocks.

Doubleclick removes a block.

Its more exciting when you turn on audio.
